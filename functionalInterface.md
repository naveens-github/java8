## Functional interface
* Interface which contains single abstract method. We can have static methods and also default methods but we should have only one abstract method.

##### Examples:
1. Runnable: contains only run() method.
2. Callable: contains only call() method.
3. ActionListner: contains only actionListner() method.
4. Comparable: contains only compareTo() method.
